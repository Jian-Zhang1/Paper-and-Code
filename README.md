# Paper-and-Code
This repository is created for recording medical imaging &amp; deep learning paper and code.

The files in the "Paper" folder are study papers from Prof. Huiguang He over the past five years. The files in the "Code" folder are codes connected with the papers of Prof. Huiguang He which were downloaded through github.com. 

However, only part of the codes of papers of Prof. Huiguang He could be found and collected.

Here is the list of the papers with codes:
